## Intro

[D&D](https://www.dndbeyond.com) can easily be complicated for
a new player, especially when it comes to creating characters and figuring out
all the attack and damage bonues from weapons and spells.

Of course, there are many tools to automate that, including ones which track HP
(hit points) of characters and enemies and automatically throw dices. However,
use of those tools inevitable leads to players being distracted merely by
presence of an electronic device such as a smartphone, tablet, or a laptop. This
happens even if players are located on the same table in the very same room.

I recently had an experience of running a D&D game as a DM for new players and
I decided to make a small reference cards which would help them with actions
available to their characters in combat encounters (at least).

What I currently have is some cards made in Pages macOS app, which are simple
rounded rectangles with text in them (aligned using empty lines of different
line height, yay!). The look like this: ![image](https://github.com/AlexeySachkov/dnd-action-cards/assets/6417047/e99078ff-8c46-4598-b7cc-6560b160a1f4)

They are not really big (56 x 89 millimiters), because I was aiming for
[Wingspan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan) cards size which
I have [sleeves](https://www.rykergames.com/products/wingspan-card-sleeve-kit)
for.

So, I just made a bunch of those cards for each party member, printed them, cut
them out and sleeved. The result is quite good and they turned out to be pretty
useful during the game.

_Left to right: original cards I did (scale was screwed up during printing),
a version using a better printer (and the correct scale),
a version produced by this script (not the latest one of course)_

Going forward, we have decided to continue playing with that party for at least
a few more sessions and characters are going to level up and change slightly.
They were originally pre-made by me, but now I'm allowing players to make
changes according to their preferences, including class changes (which wouldn't
be necessary at all if not for mistranslation/miscommunication).

Anyway, I decided that doing those cards in a text editor is a pain and I would
like to automate it somehow. Spent some time googling various editors, but ended
up with [nanDECK](https://www.nandeck.com/) (who even cares about the result,
when you can **code** your cards?!).

This repo is intended to contain all the code and inputs I have for the deck I
will create with this tool. As you may have guessed, the deck may never be
complete, but at least for now it is fun digging into the docs and writing
some code. [Automation](https://xkcd.com/1319/).

## Current status

[weapons-deck](weapons-deck.txt) script is capable of generating cards for all
weapons (non-magical) available in [SRD](srd). There are some `TODO`s
here and there and things which can be improved, but the basic functionality
is there.

[armor-deck](armor-deck.txt) script is capable of generating cards for all
armor (non-magical) available in [SRD](srd).

Both scripts generate cards which are tailored to specific character and they
use two auxiliary data sources for that:

- "character sheet" describing character stats. [Example](data/Orianna.csv)
- character inventory. [Example](data/Orianna-inventory.csv)

## Future plans

* See all `TODO`s there are in the scripts
* Support for feats (racial, class, etc.)
* Support for magic weapons
* Support for magic items
* Support for spells
