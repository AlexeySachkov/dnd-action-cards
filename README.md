# dnd-action-cards

[Dungeons and Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com) can easily be complicated for a new player,
especially when it comes to creating characters and figuring out all the attack and damage
bonues from weapons and spells.

Of course, there are many tools to automate that, including ones which track HP of
characters and enemies and automatically throw dices. However, use of those tools
inevitable leads to players being distracted merely by presence of an electronic
device such as a smartphone, tablet, or a laptop. This happens even if players
are located on the same table in the very same room.

I recently had an experience fo running a D&D game as a DM for new players and
I decided to make a small reference cards which would help them with actions
available to their characters in combat encounters (at least).

What I currently have is some cards made in Pages macOS app, which are simple
rounded rectangles with text in them (aligned using empty lines of different
line height, yay!). The look like this: ![image](https://github.com/AlexeySachkov/dnd-action-cards/assets/6417047/e99078ff-8c46-4598-b7cc-6560b160a1f4)

They are not really big (56 x 89 millimiters), because I was aiming for
Wingspan cards size, for which I have [sleeves](https://www.rykergames.com/products/wingspan-card-sleeve-kit).

So, I just made a bunch of those for each party member, printed them, cut them
out and sleeved. The result is actually quite good and it turned out to be pretty
useful during the game.

Ping me in issues if you want a photo of a result, I can attach it here.

Going forward, we have decided to continue playing with that party for at least
a few more sessions and characters are going to level up and change slightly.
They were originally pre-made by me, but now I'm allowing players to make
changes according to their preferences, including class changes (which wouldn't
be necessary at all if not for mistranslation/miscommunication).

Anyway, I decided that doing those cards in a text editor is a pain and I would
like to automate it somehow. Spent some time googling various editors, but ended
up with [nanDECK](https://www.nandeck.com/) (who even cares about the result,
when you can **code** your cards?!).

This repo is intended to contain all the code and inputs I have for the deck I
will create with this tool. As you may have guessed, the deck may never be
complete, but at least for now it is fun digging into the docs and writing
some code. [Automation](https://xkcd.com/1319/).
