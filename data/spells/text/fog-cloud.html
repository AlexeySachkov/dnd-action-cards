You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within 
range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It 
lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 
10 miles per hour) disperses it.<br />
    <b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 
feet for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>.
