The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and 
sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the 
duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing 
damage for every 5 feet it travels.<br />
    The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any 
creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a 
Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain 
as hazardous before entering it.
