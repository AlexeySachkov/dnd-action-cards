You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a 
Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are 
fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell 
ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed 
creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the 
creature knows it was charmed by you.<br />
    <b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell 
slot of 2<sup>nd</sup> level or higher, you can target one additional creature 
for each slot level above 1<sup>st</sup>. The creatures must be within 30 feet 
of each other when you target them.
