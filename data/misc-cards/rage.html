In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage 
as a bonus action.<br />
    While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy 
armor:<br />
<ul>
  <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
  <li>
    When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the 
    damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in 
    the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
  </li>
  <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
</ul>
If you are able to cast spell, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while 
raging.<br />
    Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you ar eknocked unconscious 
or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creatuire since you 
last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn 
as a bonus action.<br />
    Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in 
the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you 
can rage again.
