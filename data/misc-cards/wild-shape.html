Starting at 2<sup>nd</sup> level, you can use your bonus action to magically 
assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature 
twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. <br />
    Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in 
the Beast Shapes table: <br />
